The allocations for the scheme have increased only marginally in 2016-17 (BE) over 2015-16 (RE). The announcement of 3000 Jan Aushadhi centres is a welcome step but some of the main problems plaguing the scheme, viz. doctors not prescribing generic medicines to the patients and the non-availability of medicines under their generic names, still need to be tackled.","The Jan Aushadhi scheme is under the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilisers"
