* There is no major announcement for school education. The National Education Mission(NEM) has received an additional allocation of Rs. 1,226 crore from 2016-17(BE), primarily on account of an increase in the SSA budget by Rs. 1,000 crore.

In the last year’s budget ‘Education, Skill Development and Job Creation’ was hailed as one of the distinct ‘pillars’ that will transform India. This year, education, skill development and job creation have been presented merely as the proposal for ‘Youth’. The budget does not make any major announcements for the education sector as a whole. Surprisingly, the Budget speech overlooked any discussion on the financing of ‘Right to Education’ and elementary education despite widely shared concerns on low learning levels and scope for much needed improvement.

In 2017-18 (BE), MHRD has been allocated with Rs. 79,686 crore, 58 percent of which is allocated for Dept. of School Education and Literacy and 42 percent for Dept. of Higher Education. The distribution of MHRD budget shows clear signs of re-prioritisation towards higher education over time.

Though, the budgetary provision for the sector has shown a 10 percent increase in 2017-18 (BE), the budgetary allocation as compared to GDP has decreased from 0.48 percent in 2016-17 (BE) to 0.47 percent in 2017-18 (BE). The share of education in total Union Budget remains stagnant at 3.7 percent as was in 2016-17 Budget Estimates. Many of the promises made in the 2016-17 (BE) for the education sector do not get substantial resource support in this budget. The promises for setting up of 62 ‘Navodaya Vidyalaya’ in uncovered districts has been supported only by an additional allocation of Rs. 229 crore.
