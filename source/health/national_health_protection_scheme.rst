The figures include the allocations for Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana(RSBY) under both the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and Ministry of Labour & Employment. Since 2015-16, RSBY has been divided into two distinct components - Social Security for the unorganised workers and provision for health services. The card would be provided by Ministry of Labour and Employment and the health services would be provided by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The RSBY was renamed RSSY in 2016-17 and NHPS in 2017-18. Moreover the allocation, mentioned under RSSY for 2016-17 (BE) in the last budget documents was Rs. 1641.5 crore. This yearâ€™s document gives the figure for NHPS (erstwhile RSSY) as Rs. 1500 crore for 2016-17 (BE).

The National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS), announced in the last budget, was supposed to provide health cover up to Rs.1 lakh per family for poor and economically weak families. However, it is not clear whether the erstwhile RSSY (RSBY) has merely been renamed as NHPS, without any change in the entitlement under the scheme. The 2017-18 budget does not give any evidence of this increase.
