The fourth budget of the present government is a first in many ways. The health sector too witnesses a few changes. In a departure from the previous years, the overall allocation for the health sector in 2017-18 budget (including Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of AYUSH) has increased by 27 percent over 2016-17 BE. It is expected that this upward trend in the health budget continues in the coming years.
