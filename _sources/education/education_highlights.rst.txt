In the last year’s budget ‘Education, Skill Development and Job Creation’ was hailed as one of the distinct ‘pillars’ that will transform India. This year, education, skill development and job creation have been presented merely as the proposal for ‘Youth’. The budget does not make any major announcements for the education sector as a whole. Surprisingly, the Budget speech overlooked any discussion on the financing of ‘Right to Education’ and elementary education despite widely shared concerns on low learning levels and scope for much needed improvement.
